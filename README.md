Digital Identity explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as "identity management architecture" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.

Meet the hackers and organized crime groups who want to steal your identity and money -- and learn how to protect your data and your life! Step by step, Weisman shows how to avoid risks, minimize risks you can't completely avoid, and immediately take the right steps if you're ever victimized. 
* [A Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity](https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/ref=sr_1_12) Digital identity is an infrastructure necessary to do most everything on the Internet. And while there have been many solutions through the years, it remains a problem. Companies own the digital identities of the people that use their services, centralized databases are a security risk for cyberattacks, and users have little to no control of how their data is secured. Self Sovereign Identity technologies give individuals and companies the ability to control and manage their own digital identifiers. This technology is gaining momentum as it solves previously unsolvable challenges.
* [Cyber Privacy: Who Has Your Data and Why You Should Care - April Falcon Doss](https://www.amazon.com/Cyber-Privacy-Your-Data-Should-ebook/dp/B084JMJHL1/ref=sr_1_4) In Cyber Privacy, Doss demystifies the digital footprints we leave in our daily lives and reveals how our data is being used—sometimes against us—by the private sector, the government, and even our employers and schools. She explains the trends in data science, technology, and the law that impact our everyday privacy. She tackles big questions: how data aggregation undermines personal autonomy, how to measure what privacy is worth, and how society can benefit from big data while managing its risks and being clear-eyed about its cost. This book is for readers who want answers to three questions: Who has your data? Why should you care? And most important, what can you do about it?
